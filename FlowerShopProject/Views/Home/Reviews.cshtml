                        <p>Eat Better is just awesome! I just launched a startup which leaves me with no time for cooking, so Eat Better is a life-saver. Now that I got used to it, I couldn't live without my daily meals!</p>

                        <p>Inexpensive, healthy and great-tasting meals, delivered right to my home. We have lots of food delivery here in Los Angeles, but no one comes even close to Eat Better. Me and my family are so in love!</p>
